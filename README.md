### CT3: Splitting and Joining Strings

In this critical thinking activity, we will talk how splitting and joining strings in Python environment. The brain splits it into individual phrases, or tokens, each of which conveys significance, as you read a phrase. Interpreters such as IPython tokenize sentences, splitting them into individual elements of a programming language, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and other elements. Tokens are usually divided by whitespace characters such as void, tab and newline, however the separators are regarded as delimiters, other characters may be included.
